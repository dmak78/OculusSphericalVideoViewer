Designed in collaboration with Pomp & Clout for

Works great with spherical video shot with something like http://freedom360.us/

Plug in the Rift before launching the app. If you don't have mirroring set up, hit 'f' to toggle off of fullscreen and drag the window onto the rift, then hit 'f' again to go back to fullscreen.

To play a video just drag & drop it onto the app window.
